# tools-install

## Automatic Installation

You should go to the project directory and then execute the automatic instalation script directly from the web:

```bash
curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srodrigues-adnovum/tools-install/main/tool-bootstrap-win.sh | sh
```

> CAREFULL:
>
> - You should not install scripts directly from the web without knowing what they do.
> - You should always read their source and understand what they do.


This script will uninstall previous installed plugins and install all the versions found in my github repositories
